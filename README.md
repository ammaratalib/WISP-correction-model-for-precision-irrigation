Water is one of our most valuable natural resources—especially when it comes to growing the food we eat. In Wisconsin, a tool called the Wisconsin Irrigation and Scheduling Program (WISP) helps farmers decide how much water their crops really need. This project used data science to make that improve that model. Field experiments showed that the WISP model was off in estimating how much water plants lose to the air (a process called evapotranspiration). That’s because it wasn’t fully accounting for how heat escapes from the earth, especially on clear days. By analyzing large sets of climate and energy data, we fixed this problem and improved how the model understands heat and water movement in the environment.

A regional correction is applied to the Priestly Taylor model in this project to improve the regional Wisconsin Irrigation and Scheduling Program (WISP) model used by agricultural managers. WISP model ET bias was linked to the underestimation of net long-wave radiation traced to incorrect specifications of effective clear-sky atmospheric emissivity. The results of this study highlight that improvements to energy balance parameterizations can improve ET simulations to understand critical processes underlying hydrologic and climatic variability. The knowledge gained from this project is used to correct the WISP model that is being used by growers to optimize water use for irrigation precision.

Precision irrigation means farmers use less water—without hurting crop yields. That saves water for our lakes, rivers, and communities. It also helps keep farming sustainable during hotter, drier seasons and protects local ecosystems. This project helped to support smarter agriculture, water conservation, and a healthier planet.
