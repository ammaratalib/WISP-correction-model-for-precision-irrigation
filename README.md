A regional correction is applied to the Priestly Taylor model in this project to improve the regional Wisconsin Irrigation and Scheduling Program (WISP) model used by agricultural managers. WISP model ET bias was linked to the underestimation of net long-wave radiation traced to incorrect specifications of effective clear-sky atmospheric emissivity. The results of this study highlight that improvements to energy balance parameterizations can improve ET simulations to understand critical processes underlying hydrologic and climatic variability. The knowledge gained from this project is used to correct the WISP model that is being used by growers to optimize water use for irrigation precision.
